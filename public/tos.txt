Effective Date: January 9, 2026
Last Updated: January 9, 2026

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of ShieldGram (the “Service”) and the website https://shieldgram.com (the “Site”). ShieldGram is a product/service provided by LightRunner Labs, a sole proprietorship firm having its registered office at 2/GA22, Vigyan Nagar Main Road, Kota, Rajasthan, Pin 324005 (“ShieldGram”, “we”, “us”, “our”). By creating an account, starting a trial, purchasing a subscription, or otherwise using the Service, you agree to these Terms.


1) ELIGIBILITY
You must be at least 18 years old to use ShieldGram.


2) THE SERVICE
ShieldGram provides AI-assisted moderation for Instagram comment sections. To provide the Service, you authorize ShieldGram to connect to your Instagram account via the Instagram Graph API and process comment content and related metadata.

You acknowledge:
- automated systems can make mistakes (false positives/negatives)
- you are responsible for your moderation decisions and for how you use the Service
- you must comply with all applicable laws and platform policies (including Meta/Instagram terms)


3) ACCOUNTS AND SECURITY
You are responsible for:
- maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials
- all activity that occurs under your account
- ensuring your account information remains accurate

You must promptly notify us if you suspect unauthorized access to your account.


4) INSTAGRAM / THIRD-PARTY SERVICES
The Service depends on third-party services and APIs, including Meta/Instagram, AWS, and Razorpay. These services may impose rate limits, change features, or experience outages. ShieldGram is not responsible for third-party service interruptions, changes, or unavailability.

You represent and warrant that:
- you have the right to connect any Instagram account you connect
- you have the right to authorize ShieldGram to access and process data from that account
- your use of ShieldGram will not violate Meta/Instagram policies or any law


5) TRIALS, SUBSCRIPTIONS, BILLING, AND AUTO-RENEWAL

5.1 Free trial
ShieldGram offers a 1-month free trial (unless otherwise stated at sign-up). Trial availability may be limited to one per customer/account.

5.2 Monthly subscription and auto-renewal
Subscriptions are billed on a monthly basis and renew automatically each month until you cancel.

By starting a subscription, you authorize ShieldGram (via our payment processor, Razorpay) to charge your selected payment method for:
- the subscription fee
- applicable taxes (if any)

5.3 Cancellation
You can cancel auto-renewal through your account settings (if available) or by contacting support@shieldgram.com. Cancellation stops future renewals; it does not retroactively refund charges for the current billing period.

5.4 No refunds
Unless required by law, fees are non-refundable once a billing period begins and payment is captured. This includes partial months and unused time.

5.5 Price changes
We may change subscription fees from time to time. If we do, we will provide reasonable notice and the change will apply from the next renewal period (unless required otherwise by law).


6) YOUR CONTENT, LICENSE, AND DATA USE

6.1 Your content
You (or the relevant third parties, such as Instagram commenters) retain any rights you have in content. ShieldGram does not claim ownership of your content.

6.2 License to operate the Service
You grant ShieldGram a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive license to access, process, store (as configured), and analyze content and metadata from your connected Instagram account(s) solely to provide, secure, and improve the Service, including troubleshooting and maintaining reliability.

6.3 Comment storage opt-out
Where the feature is available, you may opt out of storing Instagram comment content. Some temporary processing and limited retention may still be required to provide the Service and for security/compliance.

6.4 Model training
ShieldGram does not currently use customer/comment data to train AI models. If we decide to use data for training in the future, we will provide notice and specify the controls available (e.g., opt-in/opt-out) before using such data for training.


7) ACCEPTABLE USE
You agree not to:
- use the Service in violation of any law or regulation
- violate the rights of others (including privacy and intellectual property rights)
- interfere with or disrupt the Service, including attempting to bypass limits or access non-public systems
- introduce malware, automated scraping outside permitted use, or abusive traffic

We may take reasonable steps to protect the Service and other users if we detect abuse, fraud, or security risks.


8) TERMINATION
8.1 By you
You may stop using the Service at any time. You may request account deletion by contacting support@shieldgram.com.

8.2 By ShieldGram
While we do not intend to suspend accounts in ordinary circumstances, we may restrict access, suspend, or terminate your account if reasonably necessary to:
- comply with law, a court order, or platform requirements
- address security incidents, fraud, or abuse
- address non-payment

Where practical, we will provide notice.


9) DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES
THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SHIELDGRAM DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

ShieldGram does not warrant that:
- the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free
- moderation outcomes will be accurate or complete
- the Service will meet your specific requirements


10) LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW:
- SHIELDGRAM WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL.

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations, so some of the above may not apply to you.
