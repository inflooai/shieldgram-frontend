2) WHAT SHIELDGRAM DOES
ShieldGram helps creators and brands moderate Instagram comment sections with automated analysis. To provide the Service, ShieldGram connects to your Instagram account via the Instagram Graph API (by Meta) and processes comments posted under your posts.


3) IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT ROLES (CONTROLLER VS PROCESSOR)
Depending on the context, ShieldGram may act as:

A) Controller (for your account data)
For information about you as a ShieldGram user/customer (e.g., your login, subscription status, support communications), ShieldGram typically determines the purposes and means of processing, and acts as a data controller.

B) Processor / Service Provider (for Instagram comment data)
For Instagram comment content and commenter information retrieved from your connected Instagram account(s), you (the customer) typically determine the purposes of processing (e.g., moderating your comment section). In this context, ShieldGram processes that data on your behalf to provide the Service.

You are responsible for ensuring you have appropriate rights, notices, and legal bases to process commenter data under applicable laws and platform terms.

8) INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS
ShieldGram is operated from India. Our primary infrastructure is hosted on AWS in the United States region us-east-1. This means information may be processed and stored outside your country of residence.

By using the Service, you understand that your information may be transferred to and processed in countries with different data protection laws than your country. We take reasonable steps to protect information in transit and at rest.


9) DATA RETENTION
We retain information as follows (unless a longer period is required by law or necessary for legitimate business purposes):
- Account data: retained as long as your account is active, and for a reasonable period afterward as needed for compliance, security, and dispute resolution.
- Service logs: retained for 7 days.
- Instagram customer content (comment content and related metadata): retained for 1 month.
- Storage opt-out: if you opt out of storing comment content (where available), we will limit storage of comment content except as necessary to provide the Service and for security/compliance.

Backups may persist for a limited period even after deletion due to technical constraints.


10) SECURITY
We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect information. Examples include:
- encryption in transit (e.g., TLS)
- encryption at rest where appropriate (AWS-managed encryption)
- encrypted storage of Instagram access tokens (encrypted before storing in the database)
- access controls and least-privilege practices

No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
